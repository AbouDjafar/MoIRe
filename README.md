Mosaic Image Revealer

When a friend that I've met on social networks asks me for my picture to finally be able to see how I look, I've got the idea to ceate this funny thing.
Instead of sending my picture in one time, this app will split it into many parts like a puzzle and each day you'll send a part till the day the he/she will receive
the whole photo.

Yeah yeah, stupid idea you'll think, but hey! we only live once!
